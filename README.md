available in the [conference proceedings](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/schar24a.html). The directory $\texttt{code}$ contains the entire code base used to run the experiments (consisting of various python modules) as well as the experiments themselves (each consisting of a Jupyter notebook). See the readme therein for details.

The directory $\texttt{data}$ contains the data sets used in the experiments. References for where we obtained these data sets are contained in the experiment notebooks based on them.

Finally, the directory $\texttt{plots}$ contains all plots presented in the paper as well as some additional ones that were also generated by the experiment notebooks.
