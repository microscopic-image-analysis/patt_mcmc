### Parallel Affine Transformation Tuning of MCMC

This directory contains all source code, data sets and plots related to the
paper *Parallel Affine Transformation Tuning of Markov Chain Monte Carlo*,
presently submitted for review, with a preprint available as
[arXiv:2401.16567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16567).

The directory $\texttt{code}$ contains the entire code base used to run the
experiments (consisting of various python modules) as well as the experiments
themselves (each consisting of a Jupyter notebook). See the readme therein for
details.

The directory $\texttt{data}$ contains the data sets used in the experiments.
References for where we obtained them are contained in the experiment notebooks
they are based on.

Finally, the directory $\texttt{plots}$ contains all plots presented in the
paper as well as some additional ones that did not make the cut.
